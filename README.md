# Lbry_TURBO_SHARE_KIT
## A LBRY Publishing Mix Materials toolkit

A suite of apps to increase efficiency in sharing a large volume of material (especially videos and study material) through the lbry protocol.  
Optimized in human effort for the uploader and comfortable (more accessibility) for those who consume the materials.

## To sum up, they are:
-- Smart optimization of video files (jet merge, reencode) in lbry standards  
-- Independent grouping and partition of multiple non-video files, increasing convenience for consumption on machines with little disk space.
